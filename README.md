# K8s Istio Kiali Jaeger

### Setting up infra on AWS for Istio, Kiali and Jaeger 

## Istio

Istio is an open-source service mesh platform that provides a way to control how microservices share data with one another. It includes APIs that let Istio integrate into any logging platform, telemetry, or policy system. Istio is designed to run in a variety of environments: on-premise, cloud-hosted, in a Kubernetes container, and in services running on Virtual Machines.

## Kiali

Kiali works with Istio in Kubernetes distributions. It visualizes the service mesh topology and provides visibility into features like request routing, circuit breakers, request rates, latency and more.
In simple words, it gives the big picture of Routing/Networking.
